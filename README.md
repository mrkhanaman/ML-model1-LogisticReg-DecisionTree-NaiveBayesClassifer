## 📝 Problem Statement and Variables

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Predict whether a user can afford to purchase an iPhone based on their attributes such as age, estimated salary, gender, and bank balance.

- **Independent Variable:**  
  - `Purchased`: Indicates whether the user purchased the iPhone (target variable).  

- **Dependent Variables:**  
  - `Gender`: Binary variable indicating the user’s gender.  
  - `Age`: Age of the user in years.  
  - `EstimatedSalary`: The estimated annual salary of the user.  
  - `BankBalance`: The total bank balance available for the user.  

Each variable contributes uniquely to the prediction task, playing a critical role in model training and evaluation.

## ⚙️ Models Used

Three classification models were implemented to address the problem statement:

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Predicts the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - A non-parametric supervised learning method that splits data into subsets based on feature values.

3. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   - A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence among features.

All models were trained and tested on the dataset, using between 4 and 8 features as specified in the assignment.

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

The **Confusion Matrix** was used as the primary evaluation metric. This method was chosen due to its ability to:

- Provide a detailed breakdown of **True Positives (TP)**, **True Negatives (TN)**, **False Positives (FP)**, and **False Negatives (FN)**.
- Enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
- Highlight areas for potential improvement.

## 🚀 Conclusion

This ML Model showcases the practical application of data science techniques, focusing on:

- Feature selection and preprocessing.
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms.
- Effective evaluation and comparison of model performance.

The project reinforces theoretical knowledge and hones practical skills for solving real-world classification problems.
